/**
 * Version-stamped critical-helper auto-refresh.
 *
 * The Claude Code hooks run the PROJECT-LOCAL `.claude/helpers/*.cjs` copies,
 * not the installed npm package — so `npx ruflo@latest` does NOT update them,
 * and users don't know to re-run `init`. This module stamps the helpers with
 * the installed CLI version and, on the next CLI command, silently re-copies
 * them when the stamp is stale. Hook fixes (e.g. the ADR-174 failure-capture
 * change) then propagate to every user on their next `ruflo` command with zero
 * action required.
 *
 * This file is intentionally LIGHTWEIGHT — it is imported on every CLI startup,
 * so it depends only on `fs`/`path`/`module` at load time and lazily imports the
 * heavy generators only on the rare fallback path (source dir unresolvable).
 *
 * FORK NOTE: this fork deliberately does not pull code from an externally-
 * resolved package at runtime by default — see docs/fork-maintenance.md.
 * autoRefreshHelpersIfStale() below is opt-in (RUFLO_HELPERS_AUTO_REFRESH=1),
 * not opt-out; see the gate at the top of that function for the rationale.

/**
 * On CLI startup, refresh critical helpers if their stamp is older than the

 *
 * 1. **Project pass** — `<cwd>/.claude/helpers/`. Always attempted. The
 *    original behavior; project statuslines pin to a stamp per repo.
 *
 * 2. **Global pass** — `~/.claude/helpers/`. Opt-in via `alsoRefreshGlobal`.
 *    Fixes the "promo row missing on remote installs" bug: `ruflo init`
 *    writes helpers to `~/.claude/helpers/` too so Claude Code's global
 *    settings.json statusLine can fall back to them (executor.ts:460-462),
 *    but nothing ever REFRESHED that global copy — so any install predating
 *    a helpers change (e.g. the 2026-07-13 funnel/promo Line-3 addition)
 *    stayed frozen at the pre-feature statusline forever, even after `npm
 *    i -g @claude-flow/cli@latest`. The global pass fixes that on the next
 *    `ruflo <anything>` invocation. Same forward-only `semver.gte` guard
 *    protects against downgrade by a stale cached CLI.
 *
 *    `alsoRefreshGlobal` defaults FALSE so tests don't touch the developer's
 *    real `~/.claude/helpers/`. The real CLI entry (src/index.ts) passes
 *    `true` to activate the global pass in production.
 *
 * Best-effort, never throws. No-op for a helpers dir that doesn't already
 * contain a `hook-handler.cjs` — never creates files in an unrelated dir.
 *
