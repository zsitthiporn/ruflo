# ruflo-hook.sh — resilient invoker for ruflo CLI hook subcommands (#1921).
#
# Hooks fire on EVERY PreToolUse / PostToolUse / Stop. A bare
# `npx <pkg>@alpha hooks …` re-resolves the @alpha dist-tag and re-installs
# from cold cache on every fire, and when the install crashes (e.g. an
# arborist `Invalid Version` on npm 10.8.x) the user sees a hook error in
# Claude Code after every turn. This shim:
#   1. uses an already-installed `ruflo` / `claude-flow` binary (no install)
#      — the common case for plugin users;
#   2. does nothing when neither is present. There is deliberately no
#      `ruflo@<tag>` registry fallback: it resolves upstream's published
#      build, not this fork's, so a best-effort telemetry hook would silently
#      execute a different codebase. See docs/fork-maintenance.md;
#   3. ALWAYS exits 0 — hook subcommands are best-effort telemetry/learning;
#      a failure must never surface an error or block a turn.
#
# stdin (the hook event JSON) is passed through to the CLI unchanged.
# Usage: ruflo-hook.sh <hook-subcommand> [args…]   (the literal `hooks`
# word is prepended here, so callers pass e.g. `post-edit -f "$FILE" -s true`).

# Swallow all diagnostics — nothing this script prints should reach the host.
# stdout is silenced too because Cursor (#2613) imports Claude Code hooks under
# its stricter `preToolUse` contract that requires valid-JSON stdout and
# fail-closes on any other text. Claude Code doesn't consume this stdout either,
# so redirecting it is a pure cleanup with no functional cost.
